4 4 0 0 U U D D D L L R R R L L U U D U U R L L X

The first 4 numbers specify the dimensions and initial position in a grid - width = 4, height = 4, x = 0, y = 0 (top-left corner = (0, 0)).
After this there is a set of instructions U = up, D = down, L = left, R = right.  
The objective of the program is to create a Grid object that observes the current location and follows the set of instructions given by the input file. 
After all the instructions are followed (specified by the X character), the program will output True if the set of instructions leads to the place where it started, and False otherwise. 
In this case, the output would be True.

The x and y coordinates cannot exceed the dimensions of the grid, and they cannot be negative
So in the example above, the coordinates are bound between 0 and 3 inclusive for x and y.
If a random character is found in the sequence following the grid dimensions, then it is to be ignored.
